# The Java Library System
Have you ever been sitting there writing your own PDF generation code and find 
yourself hoping that sysadmin doesnâ€™t upgrade the company from Acrobat Reader 
from version 5.0 to 10, because your PDF would no longer render? Well never 
fear the Java library ecosystem is here to save you from that worry and thousands 
of others just like it.


## [Difference between a library and a framework](http://www.programcreek.com/2011/09/what-is-the-difference-between-a-java-library-and-a-framework/, "Difference between a library and a framework")
> The key difference between a library and a framework is "Inversion of Control". When you 
call a method from a library, you are in control. But with a framework, the control is 
inverted: the framework calls you.

The above quote sums up the idea of these examples quite well.  I was originally going 
to include Spring and JUnit in these examples, but upon further reflection that while they
are provided as library jars like everything else in the Java world they aren't strictly
what I would consider a library.  Logging is probably not exactly a library based on this
definition, but since all the calls to do work are via calls pragmatically to log some
message to an output it is less of a framework.

## Getting started
The project uses Gradle for it's builds to simplify dependency (library) management 
as well as quick and easy JAR creation for running the examples.  It does in my 
opinion abuse what you should use the Gradle multi-project support so please do not
do this with a production system.

1. Clone this project
   1. git clone https://github.com/developerSid/AwesomeJavaLibraryExamples.git
1. Change directory to the one created by the clone
   1. cd AwesomeJavaLibraryExamples
1. Build projects
   1. ./gradlew clean build
      *  This builds an uberjar for all the projects to make it easy to run the examples. 
      Normally this is something that would be handled by other Gradle plugins or you'd build a 
      classpath containing all the libraries you need. So please do not use this in production,
      instead use the Spring-boot Gradle plugin
 

## [Apache Commons](https://commons.apache.org/ "Apache Commons Proper")

Apache Commons is broken up into three parts
1. Apache Commons Proper
   1. "A repository of reusable Java components"
   1. Projects here are kept up to date and have continuing development and support.
1. Apache Commons Sandbox
   1. "A workspace for Java component development"
   1. Newer development happens here for projects that hope to one day make it into Proper
   1. May or may not be maintained anymore
1. Apache Commons Dormant
   1. "A repository of components that are currently inactive"
   1. Basically dead no longer maintained code that you can still use, but you will be on
   your own supporting it.  At least it is open source so if there is something you can
   use to bootstrap something you are working on you can always fork and maintain yourself

Root of Apache Commons Proper.  There are many sub projects here that are currently
maintained and are usually meant to solve a single problem that is reusable within your projects.
### [Apache Commons Lang](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/ "Apache Commons Lang")
* Apache Commons Lang - The Stuff nobody on the JCP thought should be in the standard 
library (because they don't actually have to write business logic in Java)
  * StringUtils - org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils
    * You should use this when
      * Avoid null checks in your code
      * Do simple String operations you do a lot of with less code
        * Strip

### [Apache Commons Collections](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-collections/ "Apache Commons Collections")
* Apache Commons Collections - Yet more things the Java Standard Library's collections should provide, but doesn't.
(However they have added a bunch of stuff inspired by this library over the years see java.util.Collections)
  * CollectionUtils - helpful utility methods for dealing with collections
    1. java -cp Collections/build/libs/Collections.jar org.devict.jlib.collections.ExampleCollectionUtils
    1. java -cp Collections/build/libs/Collections.jar org.devict.jlib.collections.ExampleCaseInsensitiveMap
    1. java -cp Collections/build/libs/Collections.jar org.devict.jlib.collections.ExampleCollectionUtils

### [Apache Commons IO](https://commons.apache.org/proper/io "Apache Commons IO")
* More useful stuff that is missing from the Java standard libary.  (However this too is less useful if you are using java 8 and NIO 2)

To Run

1. java -cp IO/build/libs/IO.jar org.devict.io.ExampleIO

### [Apache Commons CSV](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/ "Apache Commons CSV")

* Best CLI parser out there
* Used by many projects
  * OpenJDK
  * Gradle
  * Others

## [Apache PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/ "Programmatic creation of PDFs")

### Features
* Create PDFs
* Extract Text
* Print using the Java Print API
* Split & Merge
* Fill Forms
* Save as Image

To Run

1. java -cp PDFBox/build/libs/PDFBox.jar org.devict.jlib.pdf.ExampleHelloPdf
1. java -cp PDFBox/build/libs/PDFBox.jar org.devict.jlib.pdf.ExampleAddImage

## [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/ "Schema based Data Serialization")
Apache Avro is very similar to Google's Protocol buffers, however it's main advantage is that it sends the schema
the data was encoded with along with the message making it easier to evolve the schema over time.  This is useful
when building distributed systems using messaging middleware like Apache Kafka. When used with a Schema server
you can build flexible processing systems that aren't as tightly coupled as they would be if you just shared a library
of data classes for each application.  Meaning you can upgrade applications slowly allowing for different teams to
build separate parts of the system without perfect knowledge of the other applications.

The example provided here isn't as clear cut as the others because I wanted to show changing the schema slightly.

To Run

1. java -cp Avro/build/libs/Avro.jar org.devict.jlib.avro.ExampleAvroWrite > out.avro #write with an older schema to out.avro
   1. This program uses the "newer" AdvancedEmployee schema to encode the message
1. java -cp Avro/build/libs/Avro.jar org.devict.jlib.avro.ExampleAvroRead < out.avro #read with a newer schema from out.avro
   1. This program uses the "older" Employee schema to decode the message
* Your Other option is to use the unix way of doing applications you can run
  * java -cp Avro/build/libs/Avro.jar org.devict.jlib.avro.ExampleAvroWrite | java -cp Avro/build/libs/Avro.jar org.devict.jlib.avro.ExampleAvroRead

## [Apache HTTP Components](http://hc.apache.org "Components for communicating via HTTP")

### An HTTP server that responds to any request with the time.
1. java -cp HTTPComponents/build/libs/HTTPComponents.jar org.devict.jlib.http.server.HTTPServer
1. curl -v -XGET http://localhost:8080/

### An HTTP client that requests from a the above server and displays the time.
1. java -cp HTTPComponents/build/libs/HTTPComponents.jar org.devict.jlib.http.client.HTTPClient
   1. make sure you are running the above server
   
## [Google Guava](https://github.com/google/guava "Utility library of many things")

Google's Guava library is the result of many internal and external Google projects that is useful as a base for many reusable components.  Many of 
it's use cases seem more advanced than much of the stuff that available in Apache Commons.

To run the examples

1. java -cp Guava/build/libs/Guava.jar org.devict.jlib.guava.ExampleEventBus
1. java -cp Guava/build/libs/Guava.jar org.devict.jlib.guava.ExampleTable

## [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch "Logback Logging Library")
This is the logging library I prefer right now primarily because it allows for configuration through
Groovy and implements the Slf4j (simple logging facade for java) natively.

* ExampleLogback
  * Logs to stdout and to /tmp/log/LogbackExample/LogbackExample.log
  * Logging is configured to roll once per day
    * can be configured to roll on size also (as well as other custom methods)

To run the example

1. java -Dlog.dir=/tmp/LogbackExample -cp Logback/build/libs/Logback.jar org.devict.jlib.logback.ExampleLogback
   1. Note: -D is setting a Java system property (kind of like an environment variable, but only one that the JVM cares about)
   1. The log.dir system property is optional as the logging configuration does have a default.  In this case /tmp/log, if you are on Windows this will blow up
   you should change it to something else if you are using Windows to run this example.

## [JGroups clustering](http://www.jgroups.org "JGroups clustering")
  JGroups is a toolkit for reliable messaging. It can be used to create clusters whose nodes can send messages to each other.
### JGroups Example
    Terminalogy 
    - Handler: The server that will broadcast messages to listening nodes throughout the cluster
    - Agent: The node within the cluster that is listening for messages
  
To run the examples run these commands in 3 separate console windows

1. java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -cp JGroups/build/libs/JGroups.jar org.devict.jlib.cluster.JClusterHandler
   1. Starts up the broadcast server
1. java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -cp JGroups/build/libs/JGroups.jar org.devict.jlib.cluster.JClusterAgent
   1. Starts up a single instance of a receiver that receives messages from the server
1. java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -cp JGroups/build/libs/JGroups.jar org.devict.jlib.cluster.JClusterAgent
   1. Starts up a single instance of a receiver that receives messages from the server

### JGroups Example Notes:  
This JGroups structure is not the only option, but is just an illustration of how easy it is 
to build simple broadcast/receiving messages.

The example uses the default cluster configuration which is UDP.  This may not scale as far 
as you may need, and may not cross collision domains, depends on how your network is configured.

## Groovy embedded example
This illustrates how to embed a simple GroovyShell in an application to parse simple scripts.  The 
provided example parses a list of maps defined in a String to a list of maps that the Java application
can read.

To run the example
1. java -cp Groovy/build/libs/Groovy.jar org.devict.jlib.groovy.ExampleEmbeddedGroovyStringToMap

## Java Standard Library
   This is stuf that is available in the standard library
1. java -cp Stdlib/build/libs/Stdlib.jar org.devict.jlib.stdlib.ExampleDateTime
   1. shows an example of using the Java 8 time API doing simple comparisons and getting the Date Time from a file
1. java -cp Stdlib/build/libs/Stdlib.jar org.devict.jlib.stdlib.ExampleStream
   1. simple java 8 streaming example
1. java -cp Stdlib/build/libs/Stdlib.jar org.devict.jlib.stdlib.ExampleThreading
   1. simple threading example using the standard libraries threading facilities added in Java 5
1. java -cp Stdlib/build/libs/Stdlib.jar org.devict.jlib.stdlib.ExampleFileWatcher
   1. example for using the Java 7 file watching utility added
   1. need to see where the temp directory is created and then create a file called watch.test in that directory.
      1. You can also add text to that file to cause the file changed even to fire
1. java -cp Stdlib/build/libs/Stdlib.jar org.devict.jlibstdlib.ExampleURI
   1. exmaple showing some useful parsting of URI's using the java.net.URI class
   
## [Faker](https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker "Faker port for Java")
  This library is a port of Ruby's stympy/faker gem (as well as Perl's Data::Faker library) that generates fake data. It's useful when you're developing a new project
  and need some pretty data for showcase.
### Faker Example
To run the example
1. java -cp Faker/build/libs/Faker.jar org.devict.jlib.faker.ExampleFakerUsage
